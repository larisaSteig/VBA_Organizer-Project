## Create a VBA user form that will:

1. allow the user to add or delete new categories (user-defined) to a data table (these would be the columns/column headings) on the main worksheet,
1. allow the user to add or delete records (a row of a table)
1. let the user lookup different categories for a record (basically searching through the data and outputting a specific user-defined category) with the option of replacing those items.
